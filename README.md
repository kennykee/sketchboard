## üìÅ Project Structure

```
client/    # Frontend React app
server/    # Node.js backend (optional)
```

## üì¶ Built With

- React
- React Konva
- Material UI (MUI)
- Vite
- Node.js (server)

## üëç Choice of Technology:

A lean and modern JavaScript stack was selected to maximize efficiency, speed, and business value:

- **Vite (React Frontend)**  
  A next-generation build tool that delivers lightning-fast development with Hot Module Replacement and optimized production builds, ensuring excellent performance and developer experience.

- **Material UI (Design System)**  
  A robust and customizable component library that provides a clean, modern interface out of the box, accelerating UI development while maintaining a professional look and feel.

- **Node.js with Express (Backend)**  
  A lightweight, high-performance backend framework that unifies frontend and backend development in JavaScript. This reduces context switching, streamlines workflows, and enables faster delivery with fewer moving parts.

By consolidating on a single language across the stack, the technology remains simple, efficient, and easy to maintain. This approach minimizes overhead, accelerates delivery, and ensures that the application is built on a proven, future-ready foundation.
